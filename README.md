## Description

Kichiku Gemu is a platform troll game where he objective is simple, players have to find the way to pass the different levels of the game and keep the satisfaction of passing the levels since you will never be 
able to win. The win condition doesn't exist.


This game is part of the Intellectual Property: I Wanna Be The President! Is a spinoff of William Fox, played by Maria Hops during her stream.

Expect to find triggering encounters such as having to perfectly align jumps or invisible walls, because this game is part of the troll games genre.
